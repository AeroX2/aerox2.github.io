  <h3 class="section-title">About me</h3>
  <p>
    I build systems from the silicon up. Whether I'm designing 8-bit computers
    with logic gates or reverse-engineering malware in a CTF, I prefer the
    low-level details. I don't just use tools; I deconstruct them to understand
    how they work.

    Personal projects are where I experiment. I've built a portable Raspberry Pi
    gaming system with custom circuitry, a CPU from discrete logic gates, and a
    neural network trained using genetic algorithms. And I'm always moving
    forwards with new ideas, I'm currnetly in the process of building my own
    smart watch and a robot dog
