  <h3>About me:</h3>
  <p>
    I have always been deeply passionate about technology and driven by a
    curiosity to understand how things work. This passion has led me to explore
    a wide range of topics within computer science, from mastering multiple
    programming languages to studying the fundamentals of computingâ€”everything
    from high-level concepts like multithreading and concurrency, to the
    low-level logic gates that power computers. My interest in learning what
    makes a secure system has also led me to experiment with reverse
    engineering, penetration testing and security architecture.

    In my journey to expand my knowledge, I've worked on numerous personal
    projects, each aimed at learning something new. Some of my projects include
    building a portable Raspberry Pi gaming system with custom circuitry, a 3D
    printed shell, and modified C drivers for the buttons; designing an 8-bit
    computer entirely from logic gates; and developing a machine learning neural
    network trained using genetic algorithms.
